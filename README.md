# RayPhys

A header-only C++ library for basic geometry and ray intersection calculations.
The library will define geomertic primitives (vectors, rays, etc.), several
geometric objects (such as cylinders, axis-aligned boxes, elliptical cylinders,
spheres) and the intersection of primitives with all of these objects.
Eventually the code will be expanded to handle classical physics and collision
calculations.

## Install

No compilation is required for installation, just download the header files
(located in the "Source" directory).

## Examples

## Project Status

The framework is currently in the pre-release stage (i.e. v0.y.z).
